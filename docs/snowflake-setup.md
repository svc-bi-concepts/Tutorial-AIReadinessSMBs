# Snowflake Account Setup

This section walks you through setting up a Snowflake account, creating the necessary databases, and configuring the environment for the hands-on lab.

## 1. Creating a Snowflake Account

## 3. Navigating Snowflake

Before creating databases, letâ€™s explore the **Snowflake UI**.

- **Databases** â†’ Where data is stored.
- **Warehouses** â†’ Compute resources for queries.
- **Worksheets** â†’ SQL execution environment.

## 4. Creating Databases

For this hands-on lab, we need two databases:
- **PSA** (Persistent Staging Area)
- **ANALYTICS** (Final Data Warehouse)

Run the following SQL to create them:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE PSA;
CREATE DATABASE ANALYTICS;
```

## 5. Compute Warehouse Setup

Snowflake uses **virtual warehouses** to process queries. Create a warehouse for this lab:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE TRANSFORMER
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
```

This ensures:

 **Cost Efficiency** â†’ Auto-suspends when not in use.  
 **Performance** â†’ Automatically resumes when queries are executed.

## 6. Retrieving Snowflake Account Details

To integrate Snowflake with **Fivetran** and **dbt**, we need specific account details.

1. **Account URL**: This is the URL you use to log in to Snowflake.
2. **Account Name**: Found in the Snowflake UI under the profile section.
3. **Warehouse Name**: The name of the warehouse you created (e.g., `TRANSFORMER`).
4. **Database Names**: The names of the databases you created (e.g., `PSA`, `ANALYTICS`).

ðŸ“Œ[Snowflake Account Details](assets/images/snowflake_account_details.png)

Run the following SQL to retrieve the account name and other details:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT() AS ACCOUNT_NAME,
    CURRENT_REGION() AS REGION,
    CURRENT_ROLE() AS ROLE,
    CURRENT_WAREHOUSE() AS WAREHOUSE,
    CURRENT_DATABASE() AS DATABASE;
```

Make sure to note down these details as they will be required for the next steps in setting up Fivetran and dbt.


## 7. Download Login Details Template

To keep track of your login details for Snowflake, Fivetran, and dbt, download and fill out the following template:

ðŸ“„ [Download Login Details Template](assets/templates/login_details_template.txt){:download}

This template includes sections for:
- **Snowflake Account Details**
- **Fivetran Account Details**
- **dbt Account Details**

Make sure to save this file securely and update it as needed.

## Next Steps

Now that we have **databases** and a **warehouse** set up, we are ready to move on to **data ingestion with Fivetran**.
