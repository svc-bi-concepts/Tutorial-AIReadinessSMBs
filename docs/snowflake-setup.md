# Snowflake Account Setup

This section walks you through setting up a Snowflake account, creating the necessary databases, and configuring the environment for the hands-on lab.

## 1. Creating a Snowflake Account

To get started, sign up for a free **Snowflake Trial**.

1. Visit the [Snowflake Sign-Up Page](https://signup.snowflake.com/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Choose your preferred cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
3. Enter your details and complete the registration.
4. Check your email and follow the activation link.

## 3. Navigating Snowflake

Before creating databases, letâ€™s explore the **Snowflake UI**.

- **Databases** â†’ Where data is stored.
- **Warehouses** â†’ Compute resources for queries.
- **Worksheets** â†’ SQL execution environment.

## 4. Creating Databases

For this hands-on lab, we need two databases:
- **PSA** (Persistent Staging Area)
- **ANALYTICS** (Final Data Warehouse)

Run the following SQL to create them:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE PSA;
CREATE DATABASE ANALYTICS;
```

## 5. Compute Warehouse Setup

Snowflake uses **virtual warehouses** to process queries. Create a warehouse for this lab:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE TRANSFORMER
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;
```

This ensures:

 **Cost Efficiency** â†’ Auto-suspends when not in use.  
 **Performance** â†’ Automatically resumes when queries are executed.

## Next Steps

Now that we have **databases** and a **warehouse** set up, we are ready to move on to **data ingestion with Fivetran**.
