# dbt Deployment & Documentation

## Introduction

Deploying dbt models effectively ensures that transformations run on a **scheduled basis**, providing fresh and reliable data to downstream analytics.

Additionally, **documentation** serves as a **single source of truth**, helping teams understand **data lineage, model definitions, and test coverage**.

At the moment, the Explore section in dbt Cloud is empty. Let's **deploy our models** and **generate documentation** to populate it.

## 1. Setting Up a Production Environment

A production environment ensures that **only tested, validated models** are exposed to analysts.

### **Steps to Set Up a Production Environment**
1. **Go to dbt Cloud** â†’ Click **Deploy** > **Environments**.
2. **Create a New Environment**:
   - **Name**: `PRD`
   - **Deployment type**: `Production`
   - **Connection**: `Snowflake_HWZ`
   - **Deployment credentials**: Use the Snowflake credentials.
   - **Schema**: `default`

3. **Test the Connection** to ensure successful setup.

4. **Save** the environment.

## 2. Setting Up a Production Deploy Job

Go to the bottom right `+ Create job`

![dbt Production Deploy Job](./assets/screenshots/dbtDoc/dbtDoc5.png)

Select `Deploy job`

![dbt Production Deploy Job](./assets/screenshots/dbtDoc/dbtDoc6.png)

Add the following details:

- **Job name**: `PRD`
- **Environment**: `Prod`
- **Generate docs on run**: [x]

    ![dbt Production Deploy Job](./assets/screenshots/dbtDoc/dbtDoc7.png)

- **Target name**: `PRD`
- **Threads**: `16`

    ![dbt Production Deploy Job](./assets/screenshots/dbtDoc/dbtDoc8.png)



**Save** the job.

**Run now** to deploy the models to the production environment.

![dbt Production Deploy Job](./assets/screenshots/dbtDoc/dbtDoc9.png)
![dbt Production Deploy Job](./assets/screenshots/dbtDoc/dbtDoc10.png)

Success! The models are now deployed to the production environment and the documentation is generated.

Go to the **Explore** section to view the documentation.

Since we havenâ€™t added many .yml files, tests, or other features yet, the documentation is not very detailed. But this will get richer as we add more features to our dbt project.
