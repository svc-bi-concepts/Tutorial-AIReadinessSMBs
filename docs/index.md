## Welcome

This tutorial walks you through setting up a scalable, cloud-based data platform using:

- **Snowflake** for cloud data storage
- **dbt cloud** for data transformation
- **Fivetran** for data ingestion

Of course, these tools are far more capable than described above.

You'll learn how to integrate these tools efficiently and give you the foundations on how to provide high-quality analytics data.

**What You'll Achieve**

- Create and configure a cloud-based data warehouse
- Automate data ingestion and transformation.
- Set up CI/CD and version control for analytics.
- Implement data observability for quality assurance.
- Build dashboards and reports with structured insights.
