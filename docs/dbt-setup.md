## 3. Connect dbt Cloud to Snowflake with adding your developer credentials

   Go back to the **Dashboard** on the top left corner to configure your development environment.

   To enable dbt transformations, you need to add the development credentials to your connection for dbt Cloud to your Snowflake instance:

   1. Choose **Snowflake_HWZ** as your Connection.

      - Password from your snowflake account
      - Schema (leave the default)
      - Target name (leave: default)
      - Threads set to 16 (XS Warehouse starts with 8 threads)
